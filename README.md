Nexious AI Studio v4.0

    The First Fully Autonomous AI Agency Operating System
    Built for Digital Marketing Agencies, Freelancers, and AI-Native Service Businesses.

🎯 Vision
Nexious AI Studio was born from a single belief: A solo operator should be able to run a full-service digital agency without hiring a team.
In 2025, digital marketing agencies spend 60-70% of revenue on payroll, project management overhead, and coordination chaos. Nexious eliminates that. It is not just a CRM, not just a project tracker, and not just an AI chatbot. It is a complete operating system where 22 specialized AI workers handle everything from lead generation to website delivery — under one local-first, privacy-focused desktop application.
Why it was built:

    To remove dependency on 10+ SaaS subscriptions (Zapier, Notion, HubSpot, Figma, Canva, Buffer, etc.)
    To keep client data local and encrypted (SQLite + Tauri), not on someone else's cloud
    To let a single person execute like a 20-person agency
    To prove that open-weight models + API orchestration can outperform expensive enterprise stacks

🚀 What Makes It Different
Table
Traditional Stack	Nexious AI Studio
10+ SaaS tools ($500+/mo)	One desktop app (FREE)
5-10 employees	22 AI Workers
Cloud data risk	Local SQLite + Tauri binary
Manual copy-paste between apps	Autonomous pipeline: Lead → Project → Delivery
Generic AI (ChatGPT web)	Specialized workers with memory + context
✨ Core Features
🏢 Digital Marketing Command Center

    Lead CRM with pipeline stages, budget tracking (₹ support), and approval workflows
    Campaign Tracker for multi-channel marketing execution
    Social Scheduler with auto-content generation
    SEO & Research engine with SERP + deep research APIs
    Finance Dashboard with proposal → invoice → payment tracking

🤖 22 Autonomous AI Workers
Every worker is a specialized LLM agent with:

    Role-specific system prompts
    SQLite memory (context persists across sessions)
    Approval gates (critical actions need human sign-off)
    Fallback chains (Gemini → Groq → OpenRouter)

🖥️ Native Desktop App

    Tauri v2 — Rust backend, React frontend
    Cross-platform: Linux .deb/.AppImage, Windows .msi, macOS .dmg
    Lightweight — <100MB install, runs on 8GB RAM laptops
    Offline-first — SQLite runs locally; only LLM calls need internet

🧠 The Effort Behind This

    This project represents 6+ months of iterative development across 4 major versions.

    v1.0 — Concept & SQLite schema design
    v2.0 — Tauri integration + first 10 workers
    v3.0 — CRM, Approval Engine, Finance module
    v4.0 — 22 workers, ImageGen, Writer, full pipeline

What went into v4.0 alone:

    20,000+ lines of JavaScript/React code
    3,000+ lines of Rust (Tauri backend)
    22 specialized LLM prompt systems
    30+ SQLite table designs
    17 screen components with glassmorphism UI
    6 critical bug fixes (column mapping, debounce, budget input, Ollama removal, dead imports)
    Cross-platform build pipeline (Linux .deb confirmed, Windows & macOS via CI/CD)
    Complete uninstall of legacy dependencies (Antigravity 2.0 removed due to instability)

Philosophy: Build once, own forever. No SaaS rent. No vendor lock-in. Your data, your workers, your agency.
