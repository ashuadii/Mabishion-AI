# Mabishion AI — Master Traceability Matrix

**Role:** Navigation artifact — maps Enterprise Documents to current codebase.
**Not a specification.** Never defines requirements, priorities, or architecture.

**Enterprise Documents:** `/home/admin-ubuntu/Documents/MABISHION AI ALL DOCUMENTS/`
**Codebase:** `/home/admin-ubuntu/Desktop/Nexious-AI/Nexious Mickii/nexious-ai-starter`
**Last regenerated:** 2026-07-01

Regenerate this matrix whenever gaps are closed or new Enterprise Document sections are reviewed.
